title: Kubernetes Contributors 
description: Welcome to the Kubernetes community!
---


This site is the home of contributor documentation, and serves as a starting point for your journey as a Kubernetes contributor.

It is intended to be the hub for all things related to the Kubernetes Contributor experience. Who exactly is a contributor? We all are--Whether you’re writing docs, reviewing code, participating in the community and its many SIGs, everyone is welcome. We hope this site will be a pathway to success for our 35000+ Kubernetes contributors, providing current, up-to-date information on community events, contributor resources, Kubernetes SIGs, and more.

### Get Involved:

The first step is to check out the [contributor guide](/guide/). All contributors must abide by the [CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md) and [sign the CLA](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/CLA.md).

If you need help with submitting a pull request, found a bug, or have a suggestion, please join us in [Slack] and pop over to the [#kubernetes-dev channel].

Remember: No question is too small.
