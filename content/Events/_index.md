# What ?
This event brings together new and current Kubernetes contributors to connect and learn from one another. It is an opportunity for existing contributors to help shape the future of the project, and offers a welcoming space for new community members to learn, explore and put the contributor workflow to practice.
In some sense, the summit is a real-life extension of the community meetings and SIG meetings. There are three explicit goals:

- Onboard new contributors to be productive in our community
- Send contributors home with more context, knowledge, and skills about the project
- SIG-specific face-to-face collaboration

Contributor Summits mainly includes these three tracks :
* The New Contributor Workshop is for those looking to find out how to become Kubernetes contributors;
* The Current Contributor Day is for attendees who are already contributing to Kubernetes, and want to learn more or do hands-on work at the Summit;
* The Documentation Sprints are for community members who want to help with writing documentation or translating it.
