Contributor Summits bring together new and current Kubernetes contributors to connect and learn from one another. It is an opportunity for existing contributors to help shape the future of the project, and offers a welcoming space for new community members to learn, explore and put the contributor workflow to practice.

In some sense, Contributor Summits are a real-life extension of the community and SIG meetings. They aim to:

- Onboard new contributors to be productive in our community
- Send contributors home with more context, knowledge, and skills about the project
- Facilitate SIG-specific face-to-face collaboration

Contributor Summits often have three tracks:
- **New Contributor Workshop** for those looking to find out how to become Kubernetes contributors.
- **Active Contributor Track** featuring technical discussions, unconference sessions, workshops, and more for those that are actively contributing to the Kubernetes project.
- **Documentation Sprint** is for community members who want to help with writing or localizing documentation.
