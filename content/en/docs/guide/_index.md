# Kubernetes Contributor Playground

If you are looking for a safe place, where you can familiarize yourself with (some of) the Kubernetes Project's review and pull request processes, then the [Kubernetes Contributor Playground](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/contributor-playground/) is the right place for you.

## Youtube playlist

A [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL69nYSiGNLP3M5X7stuD7N4r3uP2PZQUx) of the New Contributor workshop has been posted, and an outline of the video content can be found [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/events/2018/05-contributor-summit). 

# Community

If you haven't noticed by now, we have a large, lively, and friendly open-source community.
We depend on new people becoming members and regular code contributors, so we would like you to come join us!
The [Community Membership Document](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/community-membership.md) covers membership processes and roles.

## Communication

- [General Information](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/communication)

## Events

Kubernetes participates in KubeCon + CloudNativeCon, held three times per year in China, Europe and in North America.
Information about these and other community events is available on the CNCF [events](https://www.cncf.io/events/) pages.

### Meetups

We follow the general [Cloud Native Computing Foundation guidelines](https://github.com/cncf/meetups) for Meetups.
You may also contact Paris Pittman via direct message on Kubernetes Slack (@paris) or by email (parispittman@google.com)

## Mentorship

Please learn about our mentoring initiatives [here](http://git.k8s.io/community/mentoring/README.md).
Feel free to ask us anything during our [Meet Our Contributors](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/mentoring/programs/meet-our-contributors.md) to connect with us.
# Advanced Topics

This section includes things that need to be documented, but typical contributors do not need to interact with regularly.

- [OWNERS files](/en/docs/guide/owners) - The Kubernetes organizations are managed with OWNERS files, which outline which parts of the code are owned by what groups.
