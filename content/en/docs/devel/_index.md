title: Developer Guide
---

The developer guide is for anyone wanting to either write code which directly accesses the
Kubernetes API, or to contribute directly to the Kubernetes project.
It assumes some familiarity with concepts in the [User Guide](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/) and the [Cluster Admin
Guide](http://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/).
