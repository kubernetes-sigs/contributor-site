This section contains details about the meeting and events occurring in the
Kubernetes Community.

- [Kubernetes Contributor Summits](/docs/events/contributor-summits): Contributor 
  summits bring together new and current Kubernetes contributors to connect and
  learn from one another.
- [Monthly Community Meetings](/docs/events/community-meeting): Community Meetings
   provide a forum for discussion of project-level concerns that might need a
   wider audience than a single special interest group (SIG).
- [Office Hours](/docs/events/office-hours): Office Hours is a live stream where
   we answer live questions about Kubernetes from users on the YouTube channel
- [Meet Our Contributors](/docs/events/meet-our-contributors): Meet Our Contributors
  gives you a monthly one-hour opportunity to ask questions about our upstream
  community, watch interviews with our contributors, and participate in peer
  code reviews.
